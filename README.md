# Databases
This repository is for database things in a project for Software development (PBA) in Test and Database course.

This part (database) is based on a project description which can be found [Here](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2018spring-databases-teaching-material/blob/master/assignments/Project%20Description.ipynb)

## Data

#### [CitiesFinal.csv](https://github.com/soft2018spring-gruppe10/Databases/blob/master/TestCities.csv)
id  | asciiname | latitude | longitude | cc | population
:-----:|:---------|:-------:|:---------:|:------:|:-----:
integer |  name of city in ascii | latitude in double/float | longitude in double/float | country code as 2 letters | population in integer

This .csv file has been obtained from: http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/.

Version cities5000.csv. The data has been heavily refractored to make it easier to work with. Delimiter has been changed from tab to coma, and a few colomns has been removed because they were not usefull for us.

#### [Books.csv](https://github.com/soft2018spring-gruppe10/Databases/blob/master/TestBooks.csv)
id | title | author 
:-----:|:-------:|:--------:
integer | title of book | author of book

This .csv file has been obtained from a program we've build to capture and store relevant data from many books (.txt) files. The program can be found in this repository [BookParser](https://github.com/soft2018spring-gruppe10/Databases/blob/master/BookParser/src/Main.main/java/Main.main.java).

It should also be noted, that we have removed all qoutes from title and authors, and set author and title to Unknown if we could not scrape anything nor find corresponding RDF file. Also we have changed coma's in titles and authors to middle dot. We have done this intetional. It is also known that the user will need to input the right middle dot to actully get to search for it, but with this in mind we will implement auto completion to help user with this exact inconvinience.

#### [BookMentions.csv](https://github.com/soft2018spring-gruppe10/Databases/blob/master/TestMentions.csv)
bookid | cityid | amount
:-----:|:-------:|:----------:
integer of bookid | integer of cityid | amount of occurences in integer

This .csv file has been obtained from a program we've build to capture and store relevant data from many books (.txt) files, by also corssreferencing from all the cities in "Cities csv file". The potential cities has been captured by stanfords named entity recognition software. The program can be found in this repository [BookParser](https://github.com/soft2018spring-gruppe10/Databases/blob/master/BookParser/src/Main.main/java/Main.main.java).
